# OS administration

The list is average, strong understanding of system internals is required for debugging purposes

## Windows

1. Windows server administration with strong knowledge of powershell
2. nice to have: experience with under Windows development (WDK/SDK/VS extensions management, etc)

## macOS

1. knowledge of macOS internals (SIP, polices (spctl), kernel extensions management, dtrace/dustree)
2. advanced brew usage
3. nice to have: osascript

## Linux

Not Limited to:

1. experience with debian/ubuntu administration (advanced) (fs, inodes, different config files, initramfs, advanced APT package manager, etc, endless list)
2. nice to have: ability to properly build programs from source code (with or without a build system + general toolchain understanding)
3. systemd knowledge (units, slices, mounts,targets,etc)
4. ability to debug programs (strace/gdb)
5. ability to deeply debug and understand binaries pitfals and problems (ldd, scanelf, static/dynamic linking)

2. nice to have: powercli powershell module knowledge

# Networking:

1. understanding of subnetting/netmasks/nat/dhcp + static dynamic routing
2. basic debugging tools like wireshark or tcpdump and ability to analize captured logs to spot the problem

# CI/CD

1. Azure Devops (repos, cd pipelines, artifact, multistage pipelines (ability to develop complex ones), variable groups, feeds, etc
2. GitHub Actions

# Misc:

1. packer
2. nice to have: pester framework for powershell code testing
